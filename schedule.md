While we make every effort to keep these tables up to date, **if there is ever a conflict on due date, the assignment due date in [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) supersedes anything posted here.**

**Note that when something says READ or WATCH, you must do that before coming to class.** Readings marked as optional will be drawn from for lecture, it will be helpful to read them before but not required.

**Formal Reasoning:** For each day that Prof. Mattei is teaching there will be a formal reasoning type assignment: either a technical worksheet or a Python notebook.
**Text and Historical:** For each day that Prof. Isaacson is teaching there are readings and responses that are due which give a historical perspective on technology.
**Term Project:** The Term Project includes both Textual and Technical material. You will be using multiple LLMs and writing, see the [Assignment Page](assignments.md) for more details.
